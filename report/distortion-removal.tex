\subsection{Distortion removal}
Initial investigation:\\
- "Straight lines ought to be straight" - \cite{straightlines} .\\
- "Applying and removing lens distortion in post production" - \cite{postproduction} .\\
- The algorithm (and library implementing it) which we shall refer to as IPOLdistort is based on \cite{algebraic-distortion} .\\\\
Algorithm:\\
1. We use opencv to automatically extract corners from a distorted chessboard image.\\
2. We reconstruct segments that should be straight lines from these points, using a naive algorithm which relies on the fact that opencv finds corners in a set order; the algorithm only works if all the internal points are found.\\
3. For optimal distortion removal, we use use multiple lines, both vertical and horizontal.\\
4. The actual distortion removal consists of first modelling the distortion (by determining the radial distortion coefficients) and then correcting the image based on that model. This is done using an open-source ANSI C library which uses an optimizer to determine the undistorted coefficients by minimizing the error between the radial distortion model and the image data.\\
5. Note that this usage of the algorithm only works within certain constraints: only on relatively 'clean' images of [distorted] chessboards (due to opencv), and only on uncompressed .tif images (due to the IPOLdistort library).\\
5.a) (We our work to be an extension of the functionality of IPOLdistort, which requires the user to input line segments by hand. Further work would obviously extend the functionality to cover non-chessboard images.)\\
6. SEE the IPOLdistort readme for a good (simple) explanation; it is based on \cite{algebraic-distortion}.\\

Distortion removal experiments:\\
-> Destruction testing on different chessboard types. Non-central in image, one edge stretched, non-radial distortion (waves), varying amounts of noise, varying chessboard dimensionality, varying rotation.\\
-> Compare calculated kappas on different chessboard types.\\
-> Comparison with calibration: generate fake chessboard from the calibration points (one face at a time) and compare the output of the distortion algorithm to the kappa found by calibration. Eight images x 2 faces.\\

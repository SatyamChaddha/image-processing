  abstract     = {In this document, the SURF detector-descriptor
                  scheme used in the OpenSURF library is discussed in
                  detail. First the algorithm is analysed from a
                  theoretical standpoint to provide a detailed
                  overview of how and why it works. Next the design
                  and development choices for the implementation of
                  the library are discussed and justi ed. During the
                  implementation of the library, it was found that
                  some of the ner details of the algorithm had been
                  omitted or overlooked, so Section 1.5 serves to make
                  clear the concepts which are not explicitly de ned
                  in the SURF paper [1].},

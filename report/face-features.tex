\subsection{Face features extraction}
We have implemented the SURF extractor, described in \cite{SURF},
which is an attempt to improve upon the first scale-invariant feature
extraction algorithm, SIFT, described in \cite{SIFT}. The
implementation is inspired by the OpenSURF implementation, described
in \cite{OpenSURF}, and the code structure is quite similar.
Interesting points:

\begin{itemize}
\item The response layers and filter sizes are taken from \cite{SURF}.
  This means the range of possible values for the octaves and interval
  parameters are somewhat limited (resp. 1-5 and 3-4). The OpenSURF
  implementation simply ignores the invervals parameter in the
  calculations.
\item When estimating the determinant of the Hessian matrix (from the
  filter response values), a weight of $0.9$ for the $D_{xy}$
  direction is used. This comes from the article.
\item The three implementations (ours, OpenCV and OpenSURF) use
  somewhat different threshold values. OpenCV does not area normalise
  the values (I think; the code is quite convoluted), which might be a
  good bet for why those are different. OpenSURF represents grey scale
  values as floating point values between 0 and 1, whereas we
  represent them as 0-255 int values, which should account for the
  values here.
\end{itemize}

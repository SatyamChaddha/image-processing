\section{Our program}
\label{sec:prog}
The program is written in C++ using the Qt and OpenCV libraries, and
dependent on several other libraries including OpenSURF and IPOLdistortion.
The application consists of a Qt-based GUI that allows the user to load
images, select between various image processors, select parameters and
peruse the results of the processing by zooming and panning on the
output image. Furthermore, it is possible to select points of interest
(POIs) by double clicking on the image, which can be used to select
points for the calibration algorithm. The GUI also has a log output
window for textual output from the algorithms.

Each processor is implemented as a class that specifies which
parameters are available for this processor (the parameters can be set
by the user with the help of the QPropertySelect library), and does
the actual processing. The processing is done in a separate thread, to
keep the interface responsive, and make it possible for the user to
cancel a long-running processor.

\section{Our program}
\label{sec:prog}
Our program is written in C++ using the Qt and OpenCV libraries. The application
consists of a Qt-based GUI that allows the user to load images, select between
various image processors, select parameters and peruse the results of the
processing by zooming and panning on the output image. Furthermore, it is
possible to select points of interest (POIs) by double clicking on the image,
which can be used to select points for the calibration algorithm. The GUI also
has a log output window for textual output from the algorithms. It is possible
to perform every step of functional face recognition, from the calibration that
provides the rectification data to the final PCA analysis, within the system we
have built.

Each processor is implemented as a class that specifies which parameters are
available to it. The parameters can be set by the user with the help of the Qt
property system and the QPropertyEditor library. After parameterisation, the
actual processing is performed in a separate thread, keeping the interface
responsive and making it possible for the user to cancel a long-running
processor.

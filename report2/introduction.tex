\section{Introduction}

This work is motivated by the aim of eventually creating a 3D vision system. To this end...

This report is laid out as follows. In section~\ref{sec:improvements}, we make several improvements and additions to our last project for this course. In section~\ref{sec:prior}, we discuss prior work in the field. In section~\ref{sec:prog}, we discuss our program, implementation and experimental results. This is divided into discussions of rectification in subsection~\ref{sec:segmentation}, stereo matching in subsection~\ref{sec:stereo}, and face recognition in subsection~\ref{sec:face-rec}. We give our findings in those subsections, and then briefly summarise our conclusions in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

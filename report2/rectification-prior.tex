\subsection{Rectification}
\label{sec:rectification-prior}

Rectification algorithm using the fundamental matrix, without requiring
calibration, \cite{chen03}.

Several calibration methods for trinocular images, \cite{sun03:_uncal}.

Uncalibrated matching based on feature point extraction of grey-scale images
\cite{papadimitriou96:_epipol}; works up to 10\% angle difference.

Another uncalibrated approach that uses a three-stage approach (projective
transform, similarity transform, shearing transform) to minimise the distortion
of the rectified images to ``a well-defined minimum'' \cite{loop99:_comput}.

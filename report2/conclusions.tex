\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We have implemented image rectification based on the data from our earlier work
on camera calibration, using the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from the
calibration to compute the rectification. Furthermore, we have implemented a
dynamic programming based stereo matching algorithm for creating depth maps from
the rectified images. Finally, we have implemented PCA-based holistic face
recognition using up to six channels of data from the images (RGB, hue,
saturation and depth data).

We have tested our implementation of the different parts and provide accuracy
test results for the different parts. As part of our testing efforts, we have
also improved on the testing of our calibration implementation, and provided
additional results in this report.

% TODO: This should probably be rewritten...
Overall, our test results show that we achieve reasonable results in all the
implemented parts, but with some room for improvement.

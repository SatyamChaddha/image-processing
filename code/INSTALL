INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Requirements: A c++ compiler, the Qt and OpenCV library + development
headers.

The project uses CMake as a build system. On *nix, running the
build.sh script should take care of most things (tested on Arch
Linux).

On Windows, do the equivalent of what the build script does, i.e. run
commands like this (from the directory where this file is located):

(Create the "build" directory if it doesn't exist).

cd build
cmake ..
make

This should build the executable `image-processing` which can be found
in `build/src/`.

Run cmake with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to get a debug build (will
e.g. enable array out-of-bounds checks in Qt.
